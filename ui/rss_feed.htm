    release candidate not long ago, we&#8217;re proud to release our third one in the 14.0 Helix range. Some might find
    it odd that we do so many releases in this short period of time. We can assure you that this is by intention. By
    doing more rapid releases we get better feedback if changes done by our developers are actually effective and thus
    create a better final release.</p>

    <p>This 14.0 release brings many updates and changes, not the least of which is the change to the software’s name
      and logo. The release candidate cycle will also be the first to include the official logo of Kodi! The ins and
      outs about the logo can be read <a href="http://kodi.tv/introducing-the-kodi-logo/">here</a> in case you are
      interested. A detailed changelog can be found under <a href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/milestones?state=closed"

      should you be interested. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the features that come with the 14.0
      release candidate.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>

    <p>Below we will give a snapshot of the most important fixes done since the first release candidate.</p>
    <ul>

    <h2>A Few Warnings and Notices</h2>

    <p>This release marks the switch to the new name Kodi. When you install this release candidate, your library and
      add-ons will be moved to Kodi, making reverting back to 13.2 fairly difficult. As such, it is recommended that you
      <a title="How to backup the library" href="http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Backup_the_library" target="_blank">back
        up your library</a> <a href="http://kodi.wiki/view/Backing_up_XBMC">as well as your settings</a> before
      installing Kodi.</p>

    <p>Also, as Kodi is an unsigned application on OSX, you may need to go through a slightly different process to start
      it the first time. After you have copied Kodi to the Applications folder, you will need to “right click” or “two
      finger click” Kodi from within the Applications folder and select “Open” and then accept the warning. You should
      only need to do this the first time you run Kodi.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>The release can be found on our official download page as mentioned below. This page contains our release
      candidate builds and our nightly builds for the Helix release.</p>

      your generosity in t-shirt sales, straight-up donations, and word-of-mouth evangelizing, this project has lasted
      for 12 years and through four different names, and with your help, we all believe it can last twice that long
      again. This is the very first t-shirt sale we&#8217;re doing with the new Kodi logo design. We&#8217;re mostly
      doing this sale because our developers wanted a cool new shirt, but we figured we probably weren&#8217;t the only
      ones. So if you&#8217;d like the very first official Kodi shirt, have at it. Just follow the <a

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The last few months have
    certainly been rough-and-tumble, but we are pleased to announce the release candidate cycle for Kodi 14.0 Helix.</p>

    <p>This 14.0 release brings many updates and changes, not the least of which is the change to the software&#8217;s
      name and logo. The release candidate cycle will also be the first to include the official logo of Kodi! The ins
      and outs about the logo can be read <a href="/introducing-the-kodi-logo/">here</a> in case you are interested.</p>

    <p>A detailed changelog can be found under <a href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/milestones?state=closed"
                                                  target="_blank">milestones</a> on our code repository, should you be
      interested. With that said, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the features that come with the 14.0 release
      candidate.</p>

    <h2>The Next Generation of Video Codecs</h2>

    <p><img class="alignleft" alt="ffmpeg-logo" src="http://kodi.tv/wp-content/uploads/ffmpeg-logo-300x75.png"
            width="240" height="60"/>To begin, Kodi has been updated to use FFmpeg 2.4.3 For users, this means Kodi will
      now be capable of playing back h.265 (also known as HEVC) and VP9 video codecs. This could result in dramatically
      smaller video files sizes with exactly the same level of quality. A 40 GB file could be compressed to 20 GB. A 1
      GB file could be compressed to 500 MB without any loss in perceivable quality. Users with particularly large
      libraries or interest in 4K video may be especially likely to appreciate this update. Software support for the VP9
      video codec is also included.</p>

    <p>The caveat to this update is that the decoding of h.265 is entirely software based. This means most low power
      systems, such as those operating Android or iOS, may struggle compared to the heftier HTPCs or Intel NUCs and
      ZOTAC ZBOXes that are running desktop and laptop processors.</p>

    <h2>Library Improvements</h2>

    <p>The Kodi Library is getting improvements both coming in and going out. On the input side, library scanning is
      receiving a massive speed boost, which should make the initial scan on Android and iOS devices quite a bit more
      spiritedly.</p>

    <p>On the output side, work continues, slowly but surely, on UPnP. Kodi is now significantly more compatible with
      servers like PlayOn and MediaBrowser, as client-related bugs have been dealt with. Further, communication between
      Kodi UPnP clients and Kodi UPnP servers continues to improve with proper or additional support for categories like
      date added, ratings, votes, and artwork, along with sorting for those new categories. UPnP search functions are
      also slowly working their way into Kodi.</p>

    <h2>More User Control Over Kodi</h2>

    <p>Two new features have been introduced with Kodi that should give users even more control over how the software
      works. First, users can now prevent add-ons from updating without a forced update, prevent add-on update
      notifications, or simply continue to work with add-ons auto-updating as they do today. To change add-on update
      settings, visit the Add-ons folder in System Settings, if you are using Confluence, click left with your keyboard
      or remote to open the side panel, where a number of options exist, including the option to hide any add-ons that
      aren&#8217;t expected to work in your region.</p>

    <p>Second, in the past the virtual keyboard on the screen that users of tablets and remote controls are forced to
      deal with has always been set to the western standard QWERTY style. It is now possible to change the layout to a
      variety of other language options. To do so, visit the International section of the Appearance folder in System
      Settings and select Keyboard layouts. (<strong>Pro-tip</strong>: If you are an English speaker living in the US,
      Australia, or New Zealand, you can also select a version of English that better suits your spelling style from the
      Language portion of the International section.)</p>

    <h2>Android, iOS, and embedded</h2>

    <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/retouched.png" rel="lightbox[4010]"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3924"
                                                                             style="margin: 3px;" alt="retouched"
                                                                             src="/wp-content/uploads/retouched.png"
                                                                             width="284" height="160"/></a>On the
      Android side, hardware playback improvements continue, including more and better support for various chipsets,
      improved fast forward and rewind capability, as well as 4K support for the AMLogic s802 chipset. On the iOS side,
      Airplay, which was fairly substantially broken by the update to iOS 7, appears to be almost entirely fixed on
      every platform save Android, which lacks certain software support, making Airplay playback only partially fixed on
      that platform. Additionally, support for the Freescale i.MX6 SystemOnChip has been added.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, for you tablet users we&#8217;ve now replaced the ageing Touched skin with the improved Re-Touched
      skin, which includes a number of tweaks to bring it more in line with the features Kodi has to offer.</p>

    <h2>Windows, OSX, and Linux</h2>

    <p>All three platforms continue to see improvements in audio playback and a reduction of many audio-related bugs
      that have been plaguing the platforms for a long time. Windows also sees improvement in DXVA video playback.</p>

    <h2>PVR</h2>

    <p>American PVR users will be happy to learn that Kodi 14 introduces support for ATSC sub-channels. All users of PVR
      may be happy to learn that all PVR windows have been rebuilt to be better and more efficient.</p>

    <h2>A Few Warnings and Notices</h2>

    <p>This release marks the switch to the new name Kodi. When you install this release candidate, your library and
      add-ons will be moved to Kodi, making reverting back to 13.2 fairly difficult. As such, it is recommended that you
      <a title="How to backup the library" href="http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Backup_the_library" target="_blank">back

      installing Kodi.</p>

      it the first time. After you have copied Kodi to the Applications folder, you will need to “right click” or “two

      only need to do this the first time you run Kodi.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>To download, please visit our download page. Over the next few days/weeks, we anticipate putting out additional
      release candidates fairly rapidly. As we don&#8217;t expect very many changes to features and fairly limited
      fixes, we will likely not put out blog posts for every release candidate. Instead, keep and eye on our social
      networks for updates, and Kodi itself will keep you updated when a new release candidate is ready. If fairly
      significant changes occur, we will write a blog post on the topic.</p>

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>After many weeks of designing, deliberation, and a few beers, we are pleased to present the official logo of
      Kodi!</p>

    <h2>Logo Design History</h2>

    <p>It has been several months now since we introduced the new name for the software that we all love so much. In
      that time, the feedback we took most to heart was the fact that the community wanted to have a voice in major
      changes like this in the future.</p>

    <p>So with that in mind, we went to the community for ideas and opinions on what might make the best kind of logo
      for our new name. The feedback we got was phenomenal, to the extent that we had a whole new problem: there were
      too many great ideas. Well over a hundred at last count.</p>

    <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/thumbnail-light.png" rel="lightbox[3973]"><img
      class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3991" alt="thumbnail-light"
      src="/wp-content/uploads/thumbnail-light-300x300.png" width="300" height="300"/></a>With that in mind, we did a
      few things to narrow down the results. First, we had a user vote to get an idea of which ideas were more popular,
      and where some commonalities might lay.</p>

    <p>It became clear fairly quickly that users prefered a logo that was more design mark than wordmark. Which is to
      say, most votes tilted towards single really cool designs, like play symbols, highly stylized versions of the
      letter K, and navigation buttons, rather than highly stylized versions of the entire word. The only stylized word
      that got many votes was the one for which there was a nifty animation. Beyond leaning towards design marks, there
      was a clear preference for stylized Ks and navigation arrows.</p>

    <p>The user designs and results of the user poll were provided to doghouse media, the design firm we determined to
      work with from the start. Our directive to the firm was fairly simple: try to keep it simple, try to incorporate
      as many ideas as possible without making it ugly, and make sure it works everywhere.</p>

    <p>Over the next several days, dhm provided us with about a dozen ideas. A few of the problems encountered in
      attempting to pull in user submitted ideas included converting 3D images into flat ones that are more easily
      printed, making logo ideas work on a variety of backgrounds, both light and dark, and even Team Kodi disagreement
      about which ideas should be given more or less focus in a final design.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, a team vote was held over seven of the submitted designs to get the views of everyone inside Team
      Kodi. Of the top two vote getters, doghouse media, all the designers on the team, and even a number of outside
      designers all agreed that the second place vote getter was infinitely better than first place.</p>

    <p>And thus, as required by the by-laws of the Foundation, the Foundation board held a vote to determine the final
      logo. It was unanimously agreed to follow with the universal opinions of a half dozen designers from both inside
      and outside the team.</p>

    <p>Which gets us to this logo we are pleased to present today.</p>

    <h2>Logo Usage</h2>

    <p>For users interested in using the logo for business, fansite, or other purposes, we&#8217;ve put together a
      fairly simple <a
        href="http://kodi.wiki/view/Official:Visual_Identity_Guidelines#Trademarked_Logo.2FWordmark_Usage"
        target="_blank">Logo Usage page</a> for you to browse. All usage rules are designed entirely to avoid confusion
      or associating Kodi with something that it isn&#8217;t and should mostly be common sense. If you do have a
      question though, feel free to ask in the forums.</p>

    <h2>A Challenge</h2>

    <p>Because the logo idea thread worked so well, we&#8217;ve got one last request. As previously mentioned, one of
      the most popular logos that we weren&#8217;t able to go with owed a great deal of its popularity to a REALLY cool
      animation associated with it. It was so popular internally that it reignited the idea of eventually animating the
      Kodi start screen. And so our request, our challenge to you all is this: animate the official Kodi logo. Make it
      look awesome. While it&#8217;s far too late for an animation to make it as the boot image for Kodi 14, there&#8217;s
      a very real chance that your work could be the first thing all of our over two million users see in Kodi 15 or
      sometime in the future.</p>

    <p>To submit your animation, save it as an animated gif to <a href="http://imgur.com/">imgur</a> or your preferred
      image sharing site. Then post it <a href="http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=209673" target="_blank">here in
        the forum</a>. We look forward to seeing what you come up with. Additionally, you can pull from a number of
      other official logo variations from <a href="http://kodi.wiki/view/Official:Media_center_logos">this page</a>,
      though we&#8217;ll probably prefer a dark or black background for any final animation.</p>

    <p>And thanks again to all of our thousands of users who helped us move forward with this logo. We could not have
      done it without you.</p>

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s certainly been a few
    rough-and-tumble months, but we&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of Beta cycle for Kodi 14.0 Helix.</p>

    <p>This release brings many updates and changes, not the least of which being the name of the software. For those of
      you curious, we&#8217;ve now taken the top 10 or so vote getters in the logo vote and submitted them to
      doghousemedia to see how they might pull the best qualities out of all of them and combine those qualities into
      the best possible logo for the organization. As we continue down this path, we&#8217;ll do our best to keep you
      updated.</p>

    <p>With that said, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the features that come with Beta.</p>

    <h2>The Next Generation of Video Codecs</h2>

    <p><img alt="ffmpeg-logo" src="http://kodi.tv/wp-content/uploads/ffmpeg-logo-300x75.png" width="240" height="60"/>To
      begin, Kodi has been updated to use FFmpeg 2.4.3 For users, this means Kodi will now be capable of playing back
      h.265 (also known as HEVC) and VP9 video codecs. This could result in dramatically smaller video files sizes with
      exactly the same level of quality. A 40 GB file could be compressed to 20 GB. A 1 GB file could be compressed to
      500 MB without any loss in perceivable quality. Users with particularly large libraries or interest in 4K video
      may be especially likely to appreciate this update. Software support for the VP9 video codec is also included.</p>

    <p>The caveat to this update is that it is entirely software based. This means most low power systems, such as those
      operating Android or iOS, may struggle compared to the heftier HTPCs or Intel NUCs and ZOTAC ZBOXes that are
      running desktop and laptop processors.</p>

    <h2>Library Improvements</h2>

    <p>The Kodi Library is getting improvements both coming in and going out. On the input side, library scanning is
      receiving a massive speed boost, which should make the initial scan on Android and iOS devices quite a bit more
      spiritedly.</p>

    <p>On the output side, work continues, slowly but surely, on UPnP. Kodi is now significantly more compatible with
      servers like PlayOn and MediaBrowser, as client-related bugs have been dealt with. Further, communication between
      Kodi UPnP clients and Kodi UPnP servers continues to improve with proper or additional support for categories like
      date added, ratings, votes, and artwork, along with sorting for those new categories. UPnP search functions are
      also slowly working their way into Kodi.</p>

    <h2>More User Control Over Kodi</h2>

    <p>Two new features have been introduced with Kodi that should give users even more control over how the software
      works. First, users can now prevent add-ons from updating without a forced update, prevent add-on update
      notifications, or simply continue to work with add-ons auto-updating as they do today. To change add-on update
      settings, visit the Add-ons folder in System Settings, if you are using Confluence, click left with your keyboard
      or remote to open the side panel, where a number of options exist, including the option to hide any add-ons that
      aren&#8217;t expected to work in your region.</p>

    <p>Second, in the past the virtual keyboard on the screen that users of tablets and remote controls are forced to
      deal with has always been set to the western standard QWERTY style. It is now possible to change the layout to a
      variety of other language options. To do so, visit the International section of the Appearance folder in System
      Settings and select Keyboard layouts. (<strong>Pro-tip</strong>: If you are an English speaker living in the US,
      Australia, or New Zealand, you can also select a version of English that better suits your spelling style from the
      Language portion of the International section.)</p>

    <h2>Android, iOS, and embedded</h2>

    <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/retouched.png" rel="lightbox[3921]"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3924"
                                                                             alt="retouched"
                                                                             src="/wp-content/uploads/retouched.png"
                                                                             height="160"/></a>On the Android side,
      hardware playback improvements continue, including more and better support for various chipsets, improved fast
      forward and rewind capability, as well as 4K support for the AMLogic s802 chipset. On the iOS side, Airplay, which
      was fairly substantially broken by the update to iOS 7, appears to be almost entirely fixed on every platform save
      Android, which lacks certain software support, making Airplay playback only partially fixed on that platform.
      Additionally, support for the Freescale i.MX6 SystemOnChip has been added.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, for you tablet users, we&#8217;ve now replaced the ageing Touched skin with the improved Re-Touched
      skin, which includes a number of tweaks to bring it more in line with the features Kodi has to offer.</p>

    <h2>Windows, OSX, and Linux</h2>

    <p>All three platforms continue to see improvements in audio playback and a reduction of many audio-related bugs
      that have been plaguing the platforms for a long time. Windows also sees improvement in DXVA video playback.</p>

    <h2>PVR</h2>

    <p>American PVR users will be happy to learn that Kodi 14 introduces support for ATSC sub-channels. All users of PVR
      may be happy to learn that all PVR windows have been rebuilt to be better and more efficient.</p>

    <h2>A Few Warnings and Notices</h2>

    <p>This release marks the switch to the new name Kodi. When you install this beta, your library and add-ons will be
      moved to Kodi, making reverting back to 13.2 fairly difficult. As such, it is recommended that you <a
        title="How to backup the library" href="http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Backup_the_library" target="_blank">back up
        your library</a> <a href="http://kodi.wiki/view/Backing_up_XBMC">as well as your settings</a> before installing
      Kodi.</p>

    <p>Also, as Kodi is an unsigned application on OSX, you may need to go through a slightly different process to start
      it the first time. After you have copied Kodi to the Applications folder, you will need to “right click” or “two
      finger click” Kodi from within the Applications folder and select “Open” and then accept the warning. You should
      only need to do this the first time you run Kodi.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>To download, please visit our download page. Over the next few days/weeks, we anticipate putting out additional
      betas fairly rapidly. As we don&#8217;t expect very many changes to features and fairly limited fixes, we will
      likely not put out blog posts for every beta. Instead, keep and eye on our social networks for updates, and Kodi
      itself will keep you updated when a new beta is ready. If fairly significant changes occur, we will write a blog
      post on the topic.</p>

  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://xbmc.org/?p=3886</guid>
  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>As we already mention in last <a
    href="/kodi-14-0-helix-alpha-4/" target="_blank">alpha4</a> release post, the first beta release is nearing pretty
    fast. At this moment we are only waiting for one more final change to happen and then we are good to go. We are only
    talking a week or two at most. About three weeks have past since but, yet we haven&#8217;t sat still. The list of
    changes and improvements continues to grow.<br/>
    Although we also said feature freeze was in affect, we still found some things that were worth including in the
    upcoming release. These changes had little impact on stability or have been tested quite thoroughly</p>

    <p><strong>Localised keyboard support</strong><br/>
      Although the changes are small the effects for user can be quite big as they can now use a localized keyboard.
      Thanks to several non team members the list of available keyboard keeps growing. Due to the growing list we now
      also list them alphabetical using the English language names.</p>

    <p><strong>DXVA-HQ scaling for videos (Windows)</strong><br/>
      Since this feature might cause some issues for certain video cards, it was decided that users who actually want to
      use this feature, you will have to enable this through the <a href="http://kodi.wiki/view/advancedsettings.xml"
                                                                    target="_blank">advancedsettings.xml</a> file. Of
      course this is for the more advanced users to worry about. Though it&#8217;s worth mentioning this changes as it
      could affect some of you.</p>

    <p><strong>Faster channel switching for PVR</strong><br/>
      For those that use the PVR capabilities have experienced that channel switching not always is as fast as you want
      it to be. This should now be some what improved and will switch channels a bit faster. Although there is likely
      still some gain to be made for the future.</p>

    <p><strong>Raspberry Pi audio resampling</strong><br/>
      The Pi&#8217;s GPU supports high quality re-sampling, format conversion and up/down mixing.<br/>
      This PR creates a factory for different re-sample implementations, moves the current one into ResampleFFMPEG, and
      adds a ResamplePi GPU accelerated implementation.</p>

    <p><strong>Add MMAL decoder and MMAL renderer for Raspberry Pi</strong><br/>
      DVDs with menus do not work well with omxplayer (the main R-Pi internal player). For this the R-Pi uses the normal
      internal player from Kodi which offers better support for software decode for SD codecs like divx3, msmpeg,
      sorenson spark etc. Also omxplayer doesn&#8217;t support alsa, so can&#8217;t be used with USB and I2S sound
      cards. Internal dvdplayer may behave better with dodgy timestamps and packet loss, e.g. with live TV. So for this
      support was added to dvdplayer using the MMAL api. This offers hardware acceleration, saves the processing cost of
      YUV-&gt;RGB conversion, saves the memory cost of the RGB textures for video frames and allows high quality (cubic)
      scaling.</p>

    <p><strong>iOS 8 runtime fixes</strong></p>

    <p>Due to the release of iOS 8 some new problems showed up up the new Apple OS. Some of these issue are listed below
      and have been fixed</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Orientation of our layer is borked when compiled against ios8 sdk and running on ios8 runtime (apple finally
        fixed the 90° based coordinates)
      </li>
      <li>Because of 1 orientation on external screen is messed up too when compiling against ios8 sdk and running on
        ios8 runtime
      </li>
      <li>On ios 8 runtime (independent of used SDK) the textfield above the native keyboard is hidden</li>
      <li>On ios 8 runtime (independent of used SDK) VTB HW decoder crashes on seek</li>
      <li>Several fixes concerning Airplay. It might still be possible that not all function like you want it to. Please
        know that our main developer for this part tries his best. Hopefully you understand that we are limited in both
        manpower and capabilities due to Apple constraints.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Update Windows power management functions</strong><br/>
      Our code still contained some functions that dated back to the Windows XP release. Now that we have dropped
      support for that OS a while ago it was also time to update the function. It is most likely most of you won&#8217;t
      notice it on normal usage. Due to these changes the support for the newer Windows version has improved a bit. One
      extra function has been added. When you have pending Windows updates that requires a reboot, it now gives you the
      possibility to install them if you reboot from within Kodi. Do note it will not force install any updates that you
      haven&#8217;t enabled.</p>

    <p><strong>Improvement in file handling system</strong><br/>
      This is really under the hood code changes that has greatly improved the code handling for several of the file
      systems we handle. Mainly stability and possible error handling.</p>

    <p><strong>Dolby Atmos surround sound</strong><br/>
      For the users who own the Transformers &#8211; Age of Extension Bluray (to name one), would have noticed that
      TrueHD playback didn&#8217;t work. This is caused because the Bluray includes the new <a
        href="http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-atmos.html" target="_blank">Dolby Atmos</a> sound for the
      TrueHD track. Our devs backported a fix from FFMPEG to at least retrieve the normal audio channels for playback.
      The actual Dolby Atmos functionality is of yet not supported.</p>

    <p><strong>Extending JSON-RPC even more</strong><br/>
      JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. It allows any program to communicate to Kodi by
      sending certain commands and possibly retrieve data back. This is the main method that remotes like our official
      iOS remote uses to connect to Kodi. With these additions, these remotes become even more capable of controlling
      your favourite in house media center.</p>

    <p><strong>Several other fixes done:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>* Fixed T9/SMS text input</li>
      <li>* Updated several PVR add-ons to include fixes done</li>
      <li>* SSA Subtitle fixes</li>
      <li>* Added settings for preferred Bluray playback method. &#8220;play main movie&#8221;, &#8220;show disc menu&#8221;
        or &#8220;show simplified menu&#8221;</li>
      <li>* Fix non loading of external subtitles for ISO files and Bluray directories</li>
      <li>* Fix for importing some add-on modules that depended on other modules</li>
      <li>* A lot more small fixes and tweaks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Past changes since Gotham 13.x</strong></p>

    <p>For a brief list of other features and improvements you can read the following: <a
      href="http://xbmc.org/kodi-14-0-helix-alpha-2/" target="_blank">alpha2</a>, <a
      href="http://xbmc.org/kodi-14-0-helix-alpha-3/" target="_blank">alpha3</a>, <a
      href="http://xbmc.org/kodi-14-0-helix-alpha-4/" target="_blank">alpha4</a></p>

    <h2>Add-ons</h2>

    <p>As for this Helix release, so far there have only been small things changed in regards to add-ons. So we are
      happy to say that almost all add-ons that worked in Gotham, will also work in Helix. There are of course some
      exceptions, however this should be only be a minimal amount.</p>

    <h2>Skins</h2>

    <p>Helix compatible skins in our repository at the moment are: Aeon Nox 5, Transparency!, Conq, Nebula and Black
      Glass Nova.<br/>
      As of this release all other skins that have not been updated, will become incompatible. We hope that our
      dedicated skin developers will find the time to update these when we near final release. A big thank you them all
      for their continues effort.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Due to the fact that we are nearing the beta release, we have stopped publishing new alpha release. However it is
      still possible to try out the latest changes and fixes we have mention over the past months. Through the entire
      year we daily build a bleeding edge version for users and developers to download and try. These so called &#8220;nightly
      builds&#8221; should normally considered somewhat unstable and not recommended for daily use. However since we are
      nearing beta they are actually the most stable version you can find for the upcoming 14.0 version. Should want to
      download and install the most recent build, please visit our download page as mentioned below. You will notice
      that you can still see &#8220;XBMC&#8221; in certain areas as we are still in transition to the new name, which
      takes time and needs to be done carefully. Enjoy.</p>

      please contact the correct add-on developer or website should you experience any issues.</p>

  <description>As we already mention in last alpha4 release post, the first beta release is nearing pretty fast. At this
    moment we are only waiting for one more final change to happen and then we are good to go. We are only talking a
    week or two at most. About three weeks have past since but, &amp;#8230;

    <p><strong>As you can see our mirroring server came back online nicely after the physical move. We are excited to be

    <p>Old message:<br/>
      This is just a quick note that you will be unable to download XBMC/Kodi between 2200 UTC on the 14th of october
      and 0330 UTC on the 15th of october. Additionally, you will be unable to download addons from the official
      XBMC.org repositoru during this same time period.</p>

    <p>The reason for this is that our server company, Bytemark, is physically moving the server from one datacenter to
      another datacenter. Although this will cause us to be down for a bit, we can&#8217;t wait until the server finds a
      new home (with a faster uplink as well!).</p>

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<h2>Friday, 10th of October,
    2014</h2>

    <p>Good morning everyone. As with last year, we&#8217;re going to try to keep a running update of useful info that
      comes from this year&#8217;s devcon. To begin, we&#8217;re having a number of developers and support members give
      various presentations, so we&#8217;ll start with that.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Nedscott&#8217;s Wiki Update</h2>

    <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0440.jpg" rel="lightbox[3829]"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3835"
                                                                            alt="IMG_0440"
                                                                            src="/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0440-800x600.jpg"
                                                                            width="288" height="216"/></a>For anyone who
      sees something missing in the wiki, adding a new page and linking it has never been easier. Now if you have some
      new advice, like a How-To on adding videos to the video library, you have a really easy way to add that now.</p>

    <p>First, do a search for the content. When the page isn&#8217;t found, go to the bottom of the search screen and a
      link will appear saying, &#8220;Do you want to create a new page?&#8221; You say yes, and the page is created.</p>

    <p>Then you can simply add categories to the page. At present, you do so by typing for example [[category: video
      category]].</p>

    <p>In the future there will be dropdown categories. And in the very near future, as we update mediawiki, there
      should be upcoming WYSIWYG updating.</p>

    <h2>Helix Release</h2>

    <p>Topfs2, one of the two Release Managers, is giving a talk about the Kodi 14 Helix release. These days one of the
      biggest problems from the past has become far less of an issue. Adding a patch designed to tweak one of the
      platforms, like adding an Android-specific patch, tends not to break the other platforms thanks to some great
      coding in the past few years as well as the ability to immediately build using Jenkins to ensure that everything
      builds right.</p>

    <p>We expect that, thanks to the stability, Helix should be out before the end of the year.</p>

    <h2>Forum Testing Threads</h2>

    <p>Keith first got involved with XBMC by creating a testing thread for the Apple TV 2. The purpose of the thread was
      just to provide new builds and provide a place for people exclusively to talk about testing those builds.
      Providing similar places in the forum for testing on other builds would be really nice. A point should also be
      made to more quickly elevate regular users to forum mod status, potentially with the idea of actually buying
      hardware for those forum mods to better act as testers and moderators.</p>

    <h2>The Kodi Server System</h2>

    <p>Our server is going to be physically moved on the 14th of October (Tuesday). This will result in all our mirrors
      being offline for several hours. This will disable the downloading of addons and Kodi/XBMC. A bigger post will be
      made about this.</p>

    <p>The important thing to know is that if you are using Frodo still, if you visit addons while the mirrors are down,
      your system may be locked. Addons will simply not be visible on Gotham and later.</p>

    <p>Substantial improvements have been made and are still being made to improve server speed. Trac bugs have been
      fixed that are resulting in significant improvements in speed on xbmc.org and wiki.xbmc.org. Improvements have
      also been made to the way we communicate with our mirrors to speed up the distribution of addons and other
      downloads and reduce the amount of unnecessary data crossing the pipes.</p>

    <p>In the future we&#8217;re planning on updating MyBB, the forum software, which should result a new theme in the
      future. We&#8217;re also contemplating switching from a MirrorBrainz server system to a traditional CDN server
      system.</p>

    <h2>Binary Addons (The Endless Discussion)</h2>

    <p>We use CMake to build binary addons to build addons. The benefit of using Cmake for this is building is virtually
      identical for all platforms.</p>

    <p>We build libraries as dynamic libraries. Currently only using them for audio encoder addons. Dependencies for the
      addon are built as static libraries.</p>

    <p>At the moment, we need an OSX dev to help with this.</p>

    <p>As far as Chromium goes, building the addon wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be difficult. The difficult part is
      figuring out how to integrate it into Kodi. That&#8217;s less clear.</p>

    <h2>Media Importing</h2>

    <p>The goals: import movies, tvs, whatever. From: hard disks, network shares, plugins (like youtube), and most
      importantly other Kodi instances (whether all items or items of a specific type)</p>

    <p>Ideally we want to synchronize across all devices. So if we change a poster on the computer, it should change on
      the RPi as well.</p>

    <p>Should be easy to set up. Should be able to enrich the content with additional metadata.</p>

    <p>The source: Media provider has a list of media items. Should support filtering by media type. Might support
      announcing changes. Might support updating media items.</p>

    <p><strong>Current state:</strong> The work is entirely generic. The Importer currently uses UPnP, but can add many
      other media providers. Can configure and import specific media types.</p>

    <p><strong>What is missing</strong>?: parallel database writing. Importing items from a media provider while running
      a library update doesn&#8217;t work. It crashes. Ideally, the library update will ultimately just act as another
      media provider. Only a UPnP importer is available. Music library support doesn&#8217;t exist yet. 2 way synch
      doesn&#8217;t really exist, save for playback related info.</p>

    <p><strong>To do</strong>: notifications from media providers for changes. Handling of multiple (identical) items.
      Profiles support. Scraping integration.</p>

    <h2>Kodi Server Discussion</h2>

    <p>Discussion followed from media importing to the idea of running Kodi as a headless server. At present Kodi lacks
      the ability to add new sources using json, otherwise it should mostly be capable of running as a headless server
      right now.</p>

    <h2>Kodi Logo Vote Update (sidenote)</h2>

    <p>Just FYI, as of right now, there have been 4532 votes for the Kodi logo. Awesome work everyone!</p>

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, the path to
    our new name is only partially complete. Beyond the various legal steps still needed to be taken, we need to finally
    take a step forward in the design of our new logo. The logo that&#8217;s been posted on the alpha release threads
    has been an acceptable place holder, but now is the time to get serious about selecting something more lasting.</p>

    <p>We need your help.</p>

    <p>We&#8217;ve received numerous designs of all varieties in our <a title="Kodi Logo Suggestion Thread"
                                                                        href="http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=201272"
                                                                        target="_blank">logo suggestion thread</a>. So
      many, in fact, that there are actually more submitted logos than currently active team members. Having an internal
      vote on which logos we like most is virtually impossible.</p>

    <p>So instead, we&#8217;d like to continue pulling in help from the community. To start, we narrowed down some of
      the selections just a bit, so that logos that appeared to repeat themselves were eliminated. This still left 58
      logos to consider. We then created a poll that allows anyone, users, developers, various grandmas and others to
      view the many different versions of the Kodi logo and actually vote for their favorite.</p>

    <h2>The Rules of the Kodi Logo Vote</h2>

    <p><strong>First</strong>, please only vote once.</p>

    <p><strong>Second</strong>, this is ranked voting. That means you can say which logo is your favorite, which is your
      second favorite, and so on down the line. Often, those later votes can really matter in ranked voting. If you
      like, you can just rank a single logo as first and leave all the rest ranked 58th. Or you can rank a top 10 and
      ignore the rest. Or you can rank all 58 logos. The decision is entirely yours. You can even rank all of your top
      ten as 1 and the next ten as 2 and so on.</p>

    <p><strong>Third</strong>, many logos have added colors, backgrounds, or even additional words like &#8220;entertainment
      center.&#8221; When you are deciding, please mostly vote on the design of the wordmark Kodi and any attached icon
      design.</p>

    <p><strong>Fourth</strong>, the Foundation is obliged to make the final decision, but we will almost certainly pick
      from the top three or four, and unless there are serious legal or other objections, we will do our best to stick
      with the logo that the community prefers the most. Either way, the top few logos will all be sent to <a
        title="doghousemedia" href="http://www.dhmedia.com.au/" target="_blank">doghousemedia</a>, where we will work
      with their design team to finalize the best logo we possibly can.</p>

    <p><strong>Fifth</strong>, and finally, before you begin voting, please look through all 58 logos. Our voting
      software randomizes the list for every new user so we can avoid people just voting on the first five they see, but
      this is a very serious decision with repercussions that could last years into the future. We want everyone in the
      community to be involved, but we also want everyone to take this vote as seriously as we do.</p>

    <p>And that&#8217;s it. Here&#8217;s the <a title="Kodi Logo Vote"
                                                href="http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/vote.pl?id=E_debb84ea290101a4&amp;akey=ecb409951f0d05ae"
                                                target="_blank">link to the vote</a>. Voting ends Friday, the 17th of
      October. We&#8217;ll see you on the other side.</p>

    <h2>DevCon</h2>

    <p>On a related note, we&#8217;re excited to announce that Kodi DevCon this year will begin this Friday the 10th of
      October and run through Sunday the 12th. Again, we&#8217;ll try to keep a liveblog running throughout to keep
      people up to date on various presentations and discussions. This year we plan on breaking out into smaller groups
      in the second and third day actively work on some things that benefit from real face time. We will also try to
      live blog as much of these break out sessions, but we may have less success at that point.</p>

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Kodi 14, which we gave the
    codename &#8220;<em>Helix</em>&#8220;, is slowly heading towards beta status. In this possibly last alpha release,
    we continue to focus on stability and user friendliness. Around <a
      href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues?page=3&amp;q=milestone%3A%22Helix+14.0-alpha4%22+is%3Aclosed"
      target="_blank">117 pull-request (code changes)</a> have been added past month in a variety of areas. There aren&#8217;t
    many additions that could be picked out as a real &#8220;features&#8217;. However we will highlight some of the main
    visual changes so far.</p>

    <h2>Replace Touch skin with re-Touched</h2>

    <p>This change only really affects iOS and Android enabled devices. re-Touched isn&#8217;t really a brand new skin
      as it has been available in Gotham repo as well. re-Touched is actually a slightly redesigned Touch skin with a
      different home screen layout and various tweaks in some areas. However we felt like we had to replace it with a
      more fresh and easier skin. PVR is still not included, as such you will need a different skin should you wish to
      use it.</p>

    <h2>Moving userdata for Windows users</h2>

    <p>As a result of the name change, we are also forced to make some code changes. This has resulted in the fact that
      you personal userdata folder will be moved to a new location. This will either be done at install time or initial
      run. This just means the location of the files that hold your library and settings will be moved. No data will be
      lost during this transition. After you have installed Kodi and run it, you shouldn&#8217;t even notice a thing and
      you can continue using it as always. For now only the Windows platforms has this incorporated with the following
      steps</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If User installs into a dir were kodi is already installed ask if he wants to
      overwrite it. </em><br/>
      <em> a. if user says &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8211; un-install former installation and install new </em><br/>
      <em> b. if user says &#8220;no&#8221; &#8211; he stays at the folder selection page and can re-decide<br/>
      </em></p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> If user installs into a different directory </em><br/>
      <em> a. He said no on 1.b &#8211; kodi will just be installed in the different directory </em><br/>
      <em> b. He selected the new directory initally without hitting the question in 1. &#8211; check if there is a kodi
        installation in another directory &#8211; if so &#8211; ask user if he wants us to un-install it. If no &#8211;
        kodi will be installed side by side</em></p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> At the end of installation check for an old XBMC installation </em><br/>
      <em> a. if found &#8211; ask if the user wants us to un-install it </em><br/>
      <em> a1 if user said &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8211; un-install old XBMC installation and move the userdata &#8211;
        inform the user about the moved data </em><br/>
      <em> a2 if user said &#8220;no&#8221; &#8211; keep the old XBMC installation and DON&#8217;T move the userdata
        &#8211; inform the user about the fact that kodi will use the default profile data.</em></p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> portable data is not touched at all</em></p>

    <p>Other platforms still need further testing to make this transition as smooth as possible. We will of course keep
      you up to date when this happens.</p>

    <h3>Other changes in this release</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>* support for sub-channels in PVR</li>
      <li>* update sqlite which brings some improved library speed</li>
      <li>* add support for DSD audio</li>
      <li>* add mouse support in Bluray menus</li>
      <li>* add support for EGL/GLESv2 when using X11</li>
      <li>* 4K playback on Android using AMLcodec</li>
      <li>* support for the Freescale i.MX6 SystemOnChip</li>
      <li>* improvements for DXVA video playback on Windows platform</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Add-ons</h2>

    <p>As for this Helix release, so far there have only been small things changed in regards to add-ons. So we are
      happy to say that almost all add-ons that worked in Gotham, will also work in Helix. There are of course some
      exceptions, however this should be only be a minimal amount.</p>

    <h2>Skins</h2>

    <p>Creating a skins for Kodi takes many months of designing, coding, testing, tweaking and a lot of patience to get
      it just right. However with every major Kodi (past XBMC) release there is the problem of skins becoming
      incompatible due to various code changes. So for every release people who put a lot of effort creating these
      skins, need to adapt it for the next Kodi version. This could mean that your favourite skin doesn&#8217;t work in
      the next Kodi version. We are very glad to say, that thanks to a group of skin developers, there are already 2
      Helix compatible skins available in our repository. From memory this has never happened before, that within the
      alpha stage there are already skins available for you to enjoy using. On our forum there are several more skins
      being worked on, to get these into shape for people to use. So hopefully by the time of final release, there will
      be several more available. So let&#8217;s all thank the developers for their hard work they do for the
      community.</p>

    <p>Helix compatible skins in our repository at the moment are: Aeon Nox 5, Transparency!, Conq, Nebula, Black Glass
      Nova.<br/>
      As of this release all other skins that have not been updated, will become incompatible.</p>

  <description>Kodi 14, which we gave the codename &amp;#8220;Helix&amp;#8220;, is slowly heading towards beta status.
    In this possibly last alpha release, we continue to focus on stability and user friendliness. Around 117
    pull-request (code changes) have been added past month in a variety of areas. There aren&amp;#8217;t many additions
    that could be picked out as a &amp;#8230;

  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Kodi 14, which we gave the code
    name &#8220;<em>Helix</em>&#8220;, is shaping up to be what is often called a &#8220;stability&#8221; release. As of
    this moment we have entered feature freeze.</p>

    <h3><strong>What does this actually mean for the users<br/>
    </strong></h3>

    <p>For the average user, this means a couple things. First, you could be expecting to see Kodi Beta releases coming
      out in the very near future. Second, given our fairly well documented open development cycle, there should be very
      few surprises from then until the release of Helix. By definition, the features you see now are the same features
      you will see when Helix is released with the possible exception of some smaller updates in the default skin
      Confluence. One downside you may notice is that due to changes done during development we have bumped the minimum
      requirements for skins. As of now there are already several skins which are Helix ready. Still most skin authors
      will wait till beta releases are up before they start making changes to make their skin compatible with Helix. We
      please ask your understanding for this process. Although we don&#8217;t like it either it is deemed necessary for
      the continues improvements we are making. For now and in the future.</p>

    <p>So if you&#8217;d like to see what Kodi 14.0is going to look and feel like, go ahead and install the last
      available alpha monthly or even a nightly build which you can find in the links to at the bottom of this post. We&#8217;ve
      are happy and very thankful for those that are already been using these builds. Their testing and feedback helps
      us creating an even better and more stable entertainment experience for all of you. As always, it&#8217;s
      important to remember that the alphas are definitely alpha software that you use at your own risk.</p>

    <h3>Some of the features</h3>

    <p>This upcoming release consist mostly of the continues improvements we have started since the Frodo and Gotham
      releases. This means that many developers are actually trying to improve the code of which Kodi exists. Over the
      years many new features were added, and this created a more complex product to maintain. With this Helix release
      many actually focussed on making the core program less complex again, while keeping features and even adding
      several more. As such the entire list of changes will likely not be so interesting for the average users. As such
      we&#8217;ll only list several of the changes that are noticeable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>* Ability to increase font size in Confluence skin</li>
      <li>* Add 5.1 PCM playback for Android.</li>
      <li>* Improved MusicBrainz matching from tags</li>
      <li>* Ability to choose between auto-update, notify or off for updating add-ons. This is a global setting for all
        add-ons.
      </li>
      <li>* Extend JSON-RPC which is used for by a variety of services and remotes</li>
      <li>* VP9 video codec now uses software multi-threading. This codec has no hardware support yet.</li>
      <li>* Simplifying and improving core code.</li>
      <li>* Choose to disable/notify/auto-update when add-on updates are available.</li>
      <li>* International keyboard layout</li>
      <li>* Update PVR add-ons</li>
      <li>* Redesign of the PVR windows</li>
      <li>* Various improvements to the Audio Engine, with the OSX platform as great beneficiary.</li>
      <li>* Improvements to the GUI skinning engine</li>
      <li>* Extended JSON-RPC interface</li>
      <li>* Countless smaller and larger bug-fixes throughout the program and vast improvements in every area. This
        should improve memory usage, stability, speed and user friendliness.
      </li>
      <li>* Add-ons are still compatible up to the Frodo/Gotham versions (excluding skins)</li>
      <li>* FFmpeg upgrade, this means Kodi will now be capable of playing back h.265 (also known as HEVC) and VP9 video
        codecs and 4K video.
      </li>
      <li>* Better UPnP compatibility between Kodi clients or third-party applications</li>
      <li>* Massive speed boost with scanning library or doing a clean.</li>
      <li>* Changed the Touch skin be a re-designed re-Touched skin. This of course only applies for touch enabled
        devices.
      </li>
      <li>* Support for sub-channels in PVR</li>
      <li>* Update sqlite which brings some improved library speed</li>
      <li>* Add support for DSD audio</li>
      <li>* Add mouse support in Bluray menus</li>
      <li>* Add support for EGL/GLESv2 when using X11</li>
      <li>* 4K playback on Android using AMLcodec</li>
      <li>* Support for the Freescale i.MX6 SystemOnChip</li>
      <li>* Replaced Touch skin with re-Touched</li>
    </ul>
